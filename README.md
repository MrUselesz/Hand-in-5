The project has been tested to fit the minimum requirements.

- To start run 3 nodes in individual command promt.
  each node will get a port assigned to it, depending which one you started first.
  first node will get 5000, next one 5001 etc. 5000 (The lowest possible) is the leader

- run 2 clients in individual command promt.

- connect the clients to a port, by typing one of the ports you have opened (ex: 5000)

- Now in clients you can either place a bid or see the result. 

- To crash one of the nodes, go to the command prompt of the desired note and terminate it.

- The clients will still function (as long as one node is running), and you can still bid and see the result. 

- when 5 mins have passed from the first node was intiallized. 
  The auction is over you wont be able to bid anymore. You can still se the result.
